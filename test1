1. Difference between git fetch and git pull
Answer: Git pull
Bring the changes from remote repository and merges to local 
repo automatically.
Git pull user@servername: /home/./path/central_repo

Git fetch
Bring the changes from remote repo and stores it on a separate 
branch, you can review the changes and merge it to local repo if it is 
required.
Git fetch user@servername:/home.//./central_repo/

2. What is Adcall in route53.
Answer: {{{In AWS Route 53, there is no direct feature or term called "Adcall". However, if you are referring to 
        something specific within Route 53, it might be related to one  }}}
API Calls in Route 53 (Adcall might mean "API Call")
AWS Route 53 provides a set of API calls that allow you to interact with domain registration, DNS management, and health checks.

3. What is the difference between security groups and NACL?
Statefulness:
Security Groups are stateful, meaning if an inbound rule allows traffic, the response is automatically allowed without needing an explicit outbound rule.
NACLs are stateless, so you must define separate inbound and outbound rules.

Rule Evaluation:
Security Groups evaluate all rules and apply the most permissive.
NACLs evaluate rules sequentially (lowest to highest rule number) and stop at the first match.

Scope:
Security Groups apply to individual EC2 instances.
NACLs apply to entire subnets.

Allow vs. Deny:
Security Groups allow only "Allow" rules (no deny option).
NACLs support both "Allow" and "Deny" rules.

4. what is git conflict?
Answer: Merging Conflict Will occur when the same peace of code is changed on 2 
different branches, when we try to merge those two branches, 
then merging conflict will occur,
 To resolve this issue, I donâ€˜t know whose change should I take 
to merge , so I contact developers changes the code, person 
who modified code of branch1 and branch2. Then they will 
decide and tell us whose changes should I take into merge. Then I take that change and I commit it.

5. What is git rebate.
Answer: git rebase ---> it's nothing but merge. one branch will get added to tip of another branch.
you can squash and merge versions to another branch.

git rebase branch

6. What is Multibranch pipeline.?
Answer: Multi-branch Pipeline: A multi-branch pipeline is an extension of pipeline job, It has way of automatically creating jenkins pipeline
based on the source control branches, Jenkins can then automatically discover new branches in the source control and it can create pipeline for that branch.

7. How does the Jenkins pipeline will be triggered.
Answer: 1.Build Periodically :
       if u want to shedule or build periodically that is a particular interval of time then we can select
	   build periodically option from the build triggers 
	   commits the changes when trigger at particular time ex:evey monady it will build
  
2.POLL SCM :
       POLL SCM periodically polls the source code management tool to check whether changes were made 
	   (i.e new commits) and builds the project if new commits are pushed
	   you will the commit the changes now it build in that period,it will build trigger at the particular period once 
	   we are commit done any changes
3.GitHub Webhook Trigger :
      GitHub Webhooks in Jenkins are used to trigger the build  as soon as a developer commits somethings to
	  the branch 
	  we dont specify the time it will trigger when there is new commit
Webhook: A webhook is the mechanism to automatically trigger the build of jenkins project in response to a commit pushed to git repository

8. Difference between IAM role and policy.
Answer: 
Difference Between IAM Role and IAM Policy in AWS
AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) enables you to manage permissions for AWS resources. IAM Roles and IAM Policies serve different purposes but 
work together to control access.

Feature	                                 IAM Role                          	              IAM Policy
Definition	 An AWS identity with permissions assigned to be                        A document that defines permissions (Allow/Deny) for AWS resources.
                    assumed by users, services, or applications.             
Purpose        	 Grants temporary permissions to AWS services or external users.	Defines what actions are allowed or denied on AWS resources.
Attachment	 Can be attached to AWS services (e.g., EC2, Lambda) or users.	        Can be attached to IAM Users, Groups, or Roles.
Use Case       	 Allow EC2 to assume a role to access S3.	                        Define read-only or full access permissions for a user or role.
Inheritance	 IAM Roles assume permissions via policies attached to them.     	IAM Policies define permissions but do not provide authentication.


9. How to restart the Jenkins from the URL.
Answer:  Restarting Jenkins from the URL
You can restart Jenkins using its built-in restart URLs if you have administrator privileges. 
Safe Restart:
This ensures that Jenkins waits for all running jobs to complete before restarting.
http://localhost:8080/safeRestart

////or////
Steps to Restart Jenkins via URL
Open a web browser.
Enter the Jenkins restart URL (/safeRestart or /restart).
If authentication is required, log in with an admin user.
Jenkins will restart.

10. What is git flow.
Answer: Git Flow is a branching model for Git that defines a structured workflow for collaboration and version control. 
        It is designed to handle feature development, releases, and hotfixes efficiently.
Git Flow Workflow Overview
Git Flow introduces the following branching strategy:

1. Main Branches
main (or master)
Contains production-ready code.
Every commit in this branch is a stable release.
develop
Integrates new features.
Serves as a base for feature branches.
Contains the latest merged code for the next release.
2. Supporting Branches
feature/*

Used for developing new features.
Branches off from develop.
Merges back into develop when the feature is complete.
release/*

Used to prepare a new production release.
Branches off from develop.
Allows final bug fixes and documentation updates before merging into main and develop.
hotfix/*

Used for urgent fixes to production.
Branches off from main.
Merges back into main and develop after fixing.

11. What is the difference between PV and PVC.
Answer: 
Feature	                       Persistent Volume (PV)	                                             Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
Definition	           A storage resource provisioned in the cluster.	                A request for storage by a Pod.
Created By	           Cluster administrator (manually or dynamically via StorageClass).    Developers or applications needing storage.
Binding             	   PVs exist before PVCs and are bound to PVCs.	                        PVCs request storage, and Kubernetes binds them to matching PVs.
Size	                   Defined in the PV spec (capacity.storage).	                        Defined in the PVC request (resources.requests.storage).
Lifecycle          	   Independent of Pod lifecycle; can be reused.	                        Tied to the Pod lifecycle; deleted if the Pod is deleted (unless retained).
Example Storage Backends   AWS EBS,Azure Disks,Google Persistent Disks,NFS,Local storage.       Claims resources from an existing PV or dynamically provisions storage.

12. How to configure PV and PVC.
Answer: 	persistent volume (pv)
		- It is a storage space which can be claimend to any pod in the cluster.
		- These are cluster level object and not bound to namespace.
		
		we can control the access to volume in 3 ways:
			- ReadOnlyMany(ROX) allows being mounted by multiple nodes in read-only mode.
			- ReadWriteOnce(RWO) allows being mounted by a single node in read-write mode.
			- ReadWriteMany(RWX) allows multiple nodes to be mounted in read-write mode.
		
		Note: If we need write access to volume from multiple pods scheduled in mulitple nodes then use ReadWrtieMany


	Persistent volume claim (pvc)
		- This is the object used to claim / mount the required amount of storage from persistent volume to any 
		  pod in the cluster.
		- After we create the PersistentVolumeClaim, the Kubernetes control plane looks for a PersistentVolume that 
		  satisfies the claim's requirements. 
		- If the control plane finds a suitable PersistentVolume with the same StorageClass, it binds the claim to the volume.

13. What is S3 Bucket.
Answer: Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.

14. What is the use of kube-proxy.
kube service proxy 
			(in k8s service means networking)
			- Service proxy runs on each and every worker node and is responsble for watching API 
			  server for any changes in service configuration (any network related configuration).	
			- Based on the configuration service proxy manages the entire network of worker node.

15. What is TTL values in route53.
Answer: Time to live (TTL) or hop limit is a mechanism which limits the lifespan or lifetime of data in a computer or network. ... 
        In computer networking, TTL prevents a data packet from circulating indefinitely. In computing applications,
        TTL is commonly used to improve the performance and manage the caching of data.

16. What is the default port of the Jenkins? Can we change the port number.
Answer: The default port of Jenkins is 8080 and we can the port num for this Open the Jenkins configuration file: "sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/Jenkins"
 Find the line: JENKINS_PORT="8080" ,,,,
Change 8080 to your desired port (e.g., 9090): save the file and restart the Jenkins server

18. Have you worked on EKS?
Answer: Yes

19. How to access the internet from private subnet.
Answer: A Private Subnet in AWS does not have direct internet access. However, you can provide internet access using NAT Gateway, NAT Instance.

20. What is the jump server(Bastion Host)? Why do you use it.?
Answer: A Jump Server, also known as a Bastion Host, is a highly secured server that acts as a gateway to access instances in a private network.
        It allows administrators to securely connect to instances in a private subnet while minimizing exposure to the public internet.

Why Use a Jump Server?
âœ… Secure Access to Private Instances
Instances in private subnets cannot be directly accessed from the internet.
A Bastion Host provides controlled and logged access.

âœ… Minimizes Public Exposure
Instead of exposing all instances to the internet, only the Bastion Host has a public IP.

âœ… Stronger Security Control
You can enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
Use restricted IP access (Security Groups or Firewall Rules).

âœ… Centralized Access Logging
All SSH or RDP connections go through a single monitored server.
Can be integrated with CloudTrail, AWS GuardDuty, or SIEM for logging.

21. What is chmod.
Answer: chmod command is used to change the mode of file 

22. What is chown.

23. How do you change the ownership of a file?
Answer: chown <username> <file_name> --> To change owner of a
file

24. What is grep and egrep? What is the difference between them and give a example.
Answer: grep - It is used to search for a string inside a file
        grep "pattern" filename
egrep:egrep (Extended grep) is equivalent to grep -E.
It supports Extended Regular Expressions (ERE)

Feature                        	grep                      	egrep (grep -E)
